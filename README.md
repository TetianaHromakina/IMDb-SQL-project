## Exploration of the IMDb

In this project, I explore the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) related to films, TV shows, cast, production crew, ratings, etc. The data is taken from [here](https://datasets.imdbws.com) In particular, I gathered some basic information on movies and TV shows and focused more deeply on the exploration of the horror genre. The tools I used in this project are SQL and Tableau.
On my Tableau Public profile, you can find dashboards that visualize some of the findings [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hromakina/viz/IMDbMoviesandTVShows/Dashboard1) and [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hromakina/viz/HorrormoviesintheIMDB/Dashboard1).
